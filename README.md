# Meta Bin – An Arduino-Based Smart Device for Collecting Trash


| WELCOME TO Meta Bin |

 ----------------
 | Introduction |
 ----------------

Meta Bin is a smart device that collects trash and is operated by human gestures. It is an Arduino-based trash collecting system. To carry META BIN a smart device "BUZZ" is introduced. To determine the amount of waste in the bin, there are three layers defined for three different amounts of garbage. The purpose of this research work is to build a clean environment at a low cost and make the garbage collecting processes easier.

Thank you everyone.

 >> Turn on the switch of the device.
 
--------------------
| How to use "META BIN" |
--------------------

 >> When the system starts to run, the BUZZ will go to initial mode. It will scan it's environment and go in idle mode.
 >> By simply showing the hand or garbage in front of META BIN, the lid get's opened.
 >> By moving the hand backward to forward in front of BUZZ the BUZZ will move forward.
 >> By moving the hand forward to backward in front of BUZZ the BUZZ will move backward.
 >> By moving the hand left to right in front of BUZZ the BUZZ will shift rightward.
 >> By moving the hand right to left in front of BUZZ the BUZZ will shift leftward.

| Background Informations |
---------------------------

The project META BIN will be a clean environment project. The world produces a huge amount of waste everyday. But the waste management system is not sufficient in all countries. To make the waste management system easier, this project introduces a smart device that can follow humans anywhere and collect trash autonomously to ensure better waste management system. This smart device can help reduce trouble for people who collect trash from roads. By putting such devices on the streets, the task of collecting garbage can be made easier. The smart device is controlled entirely by an Arduino Mega microcontroller. IoT is linked to make the process easier for authorities and to provide all instructions from a single system. As a huge amount of waste is produced every day, the management process needs more attention. This project aims to improve waste management systems in countries by making waste disposal easier.

> In the next step, the BUZZ will start its work by checking the environment.
![BUZZ_START!](README_IMAGE/BUZZ_START.jpg)

> The front view of META BIN is made attractive.
![META_BIN!](README_IMAGE/META_BIN.jpg)

> There are total of 6 batteries of 1.2v is needed.
![BATTERY!](README_IMAGE/BATTERY.jpg)

> META BIN wire connection requires many wires to connect all devices.
